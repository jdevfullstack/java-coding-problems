These are the most coding problems during
technical interviews, as I experienced it myself.

specific period. They represent a snapshot of my skills and accomplishments 
at that time. As such, these projects are no longer actively maintained or updated. 
They are kept public for demonstration purposes and may not reflect my current

However, feel free to learn from these archived projects, 
preserved as they were during that specific period !

## Running The Code

It's the convenience of the Codespaces online!
Simply create a Codespace, you don't need to install
anything, just simply run using Bash.

Also starting Java 11, you can now run it even without compiling !

```
cd src
```

then 

```
java [NameOfTheFile].java
```

this is the interface of the online Codespaces
