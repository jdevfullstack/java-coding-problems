# Java Coding Problems

[![Hits](https://hits.seeyoufarm.com/api/count/incr/badge.svg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjdevstatic%2Fjava-coding-problems&count_bg=%2379C83D&title_bg=%23555555&icon=&icon_color=%23E7E7E7&title=PAGE+VIEWS&edge_flat=false)](https://hits.seeyoufarm.com)

These are the most coding problems during
technical interviews, as I experienced it myself.

## Running The Code

It's the convenience of the Codespaces online!
Simply create a Codespace, you don't need to install
anything, just simply run using Bash.

Also starting Java 11, you can now run it even without compiling !

```
cd src
```

then 

```
java [NameOfTheFile].java
```

this is the interface of the online Codespaces
